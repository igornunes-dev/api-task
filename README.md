## Overview

This is the backend of the **Task Manager** application, a secure and scalable RESTful API built with **Spring Boot** and **Java 21**. It manages authentication, task operations, and category organization with robust access control using **JWT**.

It integrates seamlessly with the Angular frontend and follows best practices for modern backend development, including layered architecture, database versioning, and containerized deployment.

## Features

* **JWT Authentication & Spring Security**
  Stateless authentication with role-based access and secure route protection.

* **Task and Category Management**
  Full CRUD support with filtering, pagination, and user ownership enforcement.

* **DTO Mapping with MapStruct**
  Clean separation of domain models and exposed data structures.

* **Pagination Support**
  Efficient handling of large task datasets using pageable API endpoints for listing and filtering.

* **Database Migrations with Flyway**
  Version-controlled schema updates for consistent environments.

* **CORS Configuration**
  Allows integration with external frontend domains (e.g., Angular app).

* **Gmail & RabbitMQ Integration**
  Automated email notifications for new user registrations and upcoming tasks.
  Uses Gmail API for sending emails.
  RabbitMQ acts as a messaging broker to queue and process email tasks asynchronously.
  Ensures reliable delivery and decouples email sending from main task processing.

* **Unit & Integration Testing**
  Implemented tests with JUnit and Mockito to ensure code reliability and coverage.

## Architecture

The backend follows a clean, layered architecture:

```
src/
â””â”€â”€ main/
    â””â”€â”€ java/
        â””â”€â”€ com.example.apitask/
            â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Global application configuration (CORS, Swagger, etc.)
            â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/       # REST controllers (define HTTP endpoints)
            â”œâ”€â”€ dtos/              # Data Transfer Objects used for requests/responses
            â”œâ”€â”€ enums/             # Enumerations for domain constraints and constants
            â”œâ”€â”€ exceptions/        # Custom exception classes and handlers
            â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/           # Utility classes and common helpers
            â”œâ”€â”€ infra.security/    # Spring Security configuration and JWT authentication
            â”œâ”€â”€ mappers/           # MapStruct mappers for converting between entities and DTOs
            â”œâ”€â”€ models/            # JPA entities (domain models)
            â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/      # Spring Data JPA repositories (data access layer)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Java 21+](https://adoptium.net/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-backend.git
cd task-manager-backend
```

2. **Build the project**

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

---

### Running with Docker

You can run the backend and database using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

* The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
* PostgreSQL will run in a separate container with persistent volume.

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

> Ensure your `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) is configured for containerized PostgreSQL.

---

## Usage

* Register a new user and authenticate to receive a JWT token.
* Use the token to access secured endpoints (e.g., create, update, and delete tasks).
* Each task belongs to a user and can be organized into categories.
* Supports pagination, filtering, and sorting on task lists.
